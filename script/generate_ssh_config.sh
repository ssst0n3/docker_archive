#!/bin/bash
# This script generates an ssh_config file based on configuration files found 
# in the current working directory and its subdirectories.
#
# For every directory that contains a .env file, the script does the following:
# 1. Extracts the IMAGE variable from the .env file (used as the Host value in ssh_config).
# 2. Verifies that a docker-compose.yml exists in the same directory.
# 3. Searches docker-compose.yml for a port mapping where the container port 22 is mapped,
#    and extracts the host port from it.
# 4. Appends an entry to the ssh_config file in the following format:
#
# Host <IMAGE>
#     Hostname 127.0.0.1
#     Port <HOST_PORT>
#     User root
#     IdentityFile <value>
#     StrictHostKeyChecking no
#     UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
#
# If the .env file contains the IDENTITY_FILE variable, its value will be used as the
# IdentityFile. Otherwise, the default value ~/.ssh/keys/docker_archive is used.
#
# The output file is always ../ssh_config/config relative to the scriptâ€™s directory,
# no matter where the script is executed from.
#
# Assumptions:
# - The .env file contains a line in the format: IMAGE=value or IMAGE="value".
# - The docker-compose.yml file includes a port mapping line like:
#       - "13239:22" or - 13239:22 (with or without quotes)
# - The host port is the number before the colon in the mapping "host_port:22".
# - The .env file may optionally include a line such as: IDENTITY_FILE=/path/to/key
